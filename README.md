# CDH-Installation-MacBook
This was my attempt at installing CDH 5.9.x on a MacBook Pro.  The pseudo installation of Hadoop worked fine but for some reason Spark would not initialize a SparkContext successfully from the Spark shell.  So, the effort was abandoned in favor of just using Spark locally or possibly from an EC2 cluster.
